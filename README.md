Description 
===========

rsstodolist is a service to build RSS feed, hosted on Google App Engine, at https://rsstodolist.appspot.com.
You can deploy the server code on your own server (https://github.com/paulgreg/rsstodolist-server) to host your private instance.

This is the rsstodolist add-on for Firefox, allowing to add URL to a RSS feed, available on the [Mozilla Add-on repository](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/rss-todolist-addon/).

Run and deploy
--------------

First, you need to install the [Firefox SDK Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/docs/sdk/latest/) via a `npm install jpm`.
To run the addon, type `./node_modules/.bin/jpm run` and `./node_modules/.bin/jpm xpi` to build the package.
